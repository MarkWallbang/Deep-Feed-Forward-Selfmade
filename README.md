# Deep-Feed-Forward-Selfmade
Neural Network for numeric predictions. Made without any Framework for learning purposes.

## Basics
This Python script trains a simple 3 layer dff neural network. It takes 2 independent variables in the input layer, feeds them forward to a 
hidden layer of 3 neurons. These again will feed calculated values forward to the output layer. In the Output layer, the predicted value is given out.

As activation function, the sigmoid is used. As loss function, the sum of squared errors is used. As optimizer, the gradient descent is used.
